                    "really required was a description of the data and a " +
                    "statement of the relationships between the data sets. The " +

                    "must break away from the sequential and not limit the " +
                    "computers. We must state definitions and provide for " +
                    "priorities and descriptions of data. We must state " +
                    "relationships, not procedures.";
